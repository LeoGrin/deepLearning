You can find in this repo some projects I worked on in 2017/early 2018 somehow related to ML and particularly NLP. Most of them are not yet user-friendly and would require some cleaning.

You can find :

- `char-RNN` : Code for a char-RNN, inspired by the article http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ but recoded from scratch.

- `from_LSTM_to_automata` : project to speed-up a LSTM trained on text by transforming it into a finite-state automaton.

- `training_projects` : smaller projects I did from training (predicting presidents from wikipedia hyperlinks, predicting the shots of Kobe Bryant, generating names from a certain country etc)
